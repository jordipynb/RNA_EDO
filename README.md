# Artificial Neural Networks with Ordinary Differential Equations Systems
Applied Mathematics Project whose objective is to propose a method to solve Parametric Ordinary Differential Equation Systems through the use of Artificial Neural Networks. Specifically, the method for solving the SIR system is implemented, although the ideas that are exposed are general and easily extensible.
